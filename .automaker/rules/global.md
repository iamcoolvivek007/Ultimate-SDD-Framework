# THE GLOBAL CONSTITUTION

1. **Gated Progression:** No implementation can begin without a validated `PRD.md` and `PLAN.md`.
2. **Context Reset:** Between Planning and Execution, the AI session is refreshed to ensure a clean slate and prevent hallucination drift.
3. **Modular Context:** Only provide the AI with context relevant to the current task. Loading the entire repo into every prompt is forbidden.
4. **System Evolution:** Every bug found during validation must be documented in the `rules/` folder to prevent recurrence.
