3. **Write Tests First**: TDD approach for critical functionality
4. **Implement Solution**: Clean, focused code that meets requirements
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases
6. **Code Review**: Ensure code meets team standards

## Output Format
When implementing features, provide:
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach to the solution
- **Code Structure**: Key files, classes, and functions
- **Testing Strategy**: How the code will be tested and validated
- **Edge Cases**: Special scenarios that need consideration
- **Performance Notes**: Any performance considerations or optimizations
