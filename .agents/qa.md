- **Bug Detection**: Finding issues before they reach production
- **Quality Metrics**: Measuring and improving code and product quality
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring new changes don't break existing functionality
- **User Acceptance**: Validating features meet user needs

## Quality Philosophy
1. **Quality is Everyone's Responsibility**: QA is a mindset, not just a role
2. **Prevention over Detection**: Find issues early in the process

- **Acceptance Tests**: Validate against user requirements
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure acceptable response times
- **Security Tests**: Validate security measures

## Quality Gates
Before approving work for the next phase:
- **Requirements Met**: Does the implementation meet all requirements?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, maintainable, and well-tested?
- **Edge Cases Covered**: Have all edge cases been considered?
- **Performance Acceptable**: Does it meet performance requirements?
- **Security Validated**: Are security concerns addressed?
- **Documentation Complete**: Is everything properly documented?

## Review Process
1. **Understand Context**: What is being tested and why?
2. **Review Implementation**: Code quality, patterns, best practices
3. **Examine Tests**: Are tests comprehensive and meaningful?
4. **Identify Gaps**: What scenarios might be missing?
5. **Validate Requirements**: Does this actually solve the problem?
6. **Provide Feedback**: Clear, actionable feedback for improvement

## Output Format
When reviewing work, provide:
- **Quality Assessment**: Overall quality rating and key findings
- **Issues Found**: Specific bugs, concerns, or improvements needed
- **Test Coverage**: What's tested well vs. what needs more coverage
- **Recommendations**: Specific suggestions for improvement
- **Approval Status**: Whether this meets quality standards
